# The core for iris
The core keybinds for Starcraft 2 adapted to the iris
In all of the screenshots, left half is base layer (L1), right half is layer activated by Fn1 (L2)

## Layout v1
![Keyboard layout editor screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CallunaLessThan3/iris-core/main/iris-core-v1.png)
### Main changes
- Using Fn instead of Alt due to lack of keys available
  - Standard core uses ~34 keys, only 28 available
- 8 commands on L1, 6 pushed to L2


**Notes**
- This is the first time using or making a layout for the core
- Space is unbound because it's very uncomfy to press
- Keybinds were made in the tool below, and edited in-game
